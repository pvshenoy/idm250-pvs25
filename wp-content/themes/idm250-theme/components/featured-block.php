    <p class="bio-description">
      Gelato has a long and rich history dating back to ancient Rome, where emperors would send runners to the mountains to collect snow and ice to mix with fruit juices and honey. The modern version of gelato, as we know it today, originated in Italy during the Renaissance period, when the Medici family held a contest to find the best frozen dessert. In the 17th century, gelato became more widespread in Italy and was served in cafes and gelaterias across the country. Over the years, gelato has evolved and grown in popularity, with new flavors and techniques constantly being developed. 
      Today, it is enjoyed all over the world and is considered a symbol of Italian culinary excellence.</p>
